# OpenBPT Service Templates

This repository contains a collection of service templates that integrate with the OpenBPT service manager. Each template provides a structured way to implement OpenBPT services, requiring developers to only specify a **run function** to define the service logic and a **manifest** to describe the service's metadata.

## Available Templates

We provide templates for multiple programming languages:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** – Available in the `javascript/` and `typescript/` directories.
- **Python** – Available in the `python/` directory.
- **Java** – Available in the `java/` directory.

## Getting Started

1. **Select a template:** Navigate to the directory of the language you want to use.
2. **Follow the setup instructions:** Each template contains a `README.md` file with step-by-step installation and configuration guidance.
3. **Implement your service logic:** Modify the `run` function to customize your service's behavior.
4. **Register and test your service:** Ensure it interacts correctly with the OpenBPT service manager.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you’d like to improve an existing template or add support for another language, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that new templates follow a consistent structure and interface to maintain uniformity across the repository.
